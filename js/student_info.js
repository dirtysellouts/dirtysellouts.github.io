	0	:	"<p>Until she was 17, my husband and I believed that our daughter would become in the future an interpreter. We hired private teachers and put the emphasis on this aspect of her education, but I always noticed her passion for art and fashion. The way she had her notebooks always painted from the inside, the way she was very pedantic when choosing clothes.</p><p>After high school graduation we gave her a chance to choose what she really wanted to do and and not to my surprise it was about art. When she was 18 years old we sent our daughter to Prague and now she is finishing her last year at the college and we are so proud of her.</p>",
	1	:	"<p>You wouldn’t meet little Alice any other way than wearing stylish clothes from head to toe with the motif of the Lion King - she had it even on her rubber bands in hair!!</p><p>You made her happy if you took her to a stationery store, where you could let her to look at and touch all kinds of papers and notebooks.</p><p>Since she was little she never, seriously never ever, arrived anywhere on time.</p><p>You could listen (but not disturb her!!) as she composed on her small electronic keyboards.</p><p>Her brutal honesty to the outer world often unsettled many people around her, mainly the adults...</p><p>Little Alice was an amazing friend, to whom you could always tell anything, and you knew that she wouldn’t spill your childhood secret to anybody! She was never a spoilsport and if you befriended her, you could even pet her little mouse Lilly, who was missing one leg and about whom Alice cared with love.</p><p>Her best friend</p>",
	2	:	"<p>Most people thought Muội was a boy when she was a kid. Because we thought we were going to have another son, we did not have anything girly for her. As a result Muội dressed like a boy and had a boy haircut until she got to the 4th grade, when she grew her hair long for the first time in her life. Muội has shown an interest in fashion since she was almost 3. She always made drawings of super long and oversized culottes trousers. She drew on papers, on the walls and on her exercise books. Muội was interested in any kind of figures, like robots and dolls, so she would make clothes for them and cut their hair (if they had any). Muội has always loved to discover new things. She likes to make her own decisions and there is no one that can stop her. We love her for who she is.</p><p>Choco’s parents</p>",
	3	:	"<p>When my daughter was born, I experienced a feeling of pride in myself and for her. A sense of beauty in the world. We have two children, and Anna is 2 years, 2 months and 2 weeks younger than her brother. For the first two years of her life, Anya was a very serious child, so we specifically placed her next to her brother to watch cartoons. Alexey, her brother, burst into laughter at every - even insignificant - situation, while she watched cartoons with a very serious expression. After a while she began to smile, and a little later she began to laugh. And so I thought maybe this was when she decided to become a great artist. After a number of years, she graduated from art school with a “red” diploma. Moreover, after graduating from the university, she informed us that this was not sufficient for her education, and again she continued to study. Nothing has changed since her birth. She is still beautiful and everything she does is done with taste and consideration. We really love our baby.</p><p>Anna’s mom.</p>",
	4	:	"<p>Arthur's childhood had nothing to do with art in any form. He was never interested in sketching or drawing. As a child, he spent the majority of his time studying physics and training karate. The first time he picked up a pencil was at his first university when he was supposed to sketch architectural blueprints. Even though that specialization wasn't connected with graphic design, he kinda enjoyed engaging with architecture. However, at that period of time, he was already interested in designing. He was spending all his time on producing various digital graphics and 3D models. Later in 2014, he decided to obtain another bachelor degree from the profession that he was highly passionate about. During three years at Prague College, he developed his skills significantly. Thanks to various school projects and assignments, he enriched his portfolio extensively. As a result, now he is ready to start his career as a graphic designer.</p>",
	5	:	"<p>Bianca has always been a bright and inquisitive child. Early on, her creative vein was characterized by the fact that she wanted to convince her friends to build her own space shuttle to explore the expanses of the universe. When she received her first Walkie-Talkie and heard some mysterious and undefined noises, she was absolutely convinced that she had finally made contact with extraterrestrial life (even if it was only the radio frequencies of our neighbours). But still today, she follows her dreams firmly and is absolutely determined to implement her ideas. Also, from a professional point of view, it does not surprise us that she has chosen an artistic direction. We will support her in all of her further projects and decisions.</p><p>Parents</p>",
	6	:	"<p>Carla was a very quiet child and instead of playing games, she wanted to draw pictures and do handicrafts all the time. There was one parents’ evening in the kindergarten when the teacher told us that we should not be afraid of paper scraps because children need to be creative. At this time I did not know that in Carla’s case the kindergarten teacher meant not only during her childhood. Carla loves to create collages and sometimes the floor of her room is covered with tiny scraps. Surprisingly, until now paper scraps have played an important role in her life.</p><p>Sabine Schwenk, her mother</p>",
	7	:	"<p>It all began on Friday, December 8, 1995, at precisely 11:20 am. That day a little wonder named Charlène was born. 3,890kg, 52cm, black hair, a pretty face and already a lot of voice: everything suggested a strong personality. This was confirmed and the main aspects of her character appeared very quickly: laughing - always laughing, eyes bigger than the belly, and a real actress.</p><p>A few years later, this beautiful laughing baby became an adorable mischievous little girl, smiling and very sociable. Then this is a serious, dynamic and applied child who took the path to school. At that time, we couldn’t say that she showed technical prowess in drawing... However Charlène always had a real attraction for manual work, a lot of imagination and a very creative spirit.</p><p>Today, she is a passionate student who is ready to take on all the challenges to make her dreams come true.</p><p>Florence Fournier, her mum</p>",
	8	:	"<p>David started to draw very early. There is barely any picture of him without a piece of paper and a pen, and he soon changed his drawings into first designs. Around 10, he was obsessed with drawing clothes, he even made a brand, called daho. When he got interested in cars, he only wanted to draw cars and wanted to become a car designer. When he became older and life was more about going out, his design obsession seemed to get less and less, but for now it seems he still hasn’t lost it.</p>",
	9	:	"<p>When David was a kid he would always spend his time playing with Lego. That was true even as he grew up. Apart from Lego, though, he’s never really drawn much or had any kind of creative pastime. Once he was old enough to use a computer on his own, he became more and more interested in video games and computers in general. A couple of times he even messed something up with the software and had to reinstall everything. Or he would take it apart and put back together just to see what’s inside. Honestly, I wouldn’t have thought he’d end up doing design.</p>",
	10	:	"<p>Dora started to scribble before she started walking. After her mother and I told her that drawing on the walls was off limits, she started finding hidden spots to draw on (under her bed, for example!). She started school and proclaimed she was going to be an artist and, of course, nobody believed that because her drawing skills were awful. She got into a language high school instead of an art school and we sighed with relief... which was very temporary because she didn't stop drawing and still claimed she would indeed do that for a living. When she told us she had been accepted into graphic design, I was sure that was going to be a complete failure. Yet, here she is, successfully graduating! I know she is good at what she does, but she'll always be that kid that scribbled on my walls to me.</p><p>Petko Ivanov, her dad</p>",
	11	:	"<p>When Eben was growing up as a kid, he always cried when his outfit got dirty. He normally slept with any new outfit we got him and no one dared to take it away from him when going to sleep. As a parent, we noticed his love for colors (color pencils to be precise) when he started school, and anywhere he went he would cry all because of color pencils. This was very disturbing for us, so we had no choice but to carry color pencils anywhere we went with him. It seemed like this was more important to him than snacks. And one thing he would normally say to people was that he would buy mummy a cat and a truck.</p><p>So seeing him now as a designer, I am not really surprised, even though we wanted him to do business.</p>",
	12	:	"<p>When our \"Lenochka\" finally learned to walk, she took a pencil into her right hand and started expressing her creativity using the walls as her canvas. Once we were annoyed with her \"graffiti\" art, she found her interest in illustrating books, by filling them in with her drawings. When she saw a single piece of paper lying somewhere, Lena immediately used it for her drawings. Her favourite character was always a bear. Outside the house, she loved to draw in the sand with the first stick she found. When we took her somewhere, we always had paper and pencils with us, because we knew that it was drawing that she liked to do. We recognized that she had some form of graphic talent, but we thought that it was just a hobby which every child had, yet later we saw that it was more than that. Her mind was asking for creativity. She has a very sensitive character and soul and we realized that she has the ability to notice things, which other people can’t.</p><p>Mom and dad</p>",
	13	:	"<p>Although Elli comes from a family of artists, her creative development needed a little bit longer to unfold. She was rather pretty good at arguing and haggling if it was about something she truly wanted (like food or books).  If she didn’t get it, she showed her stubborn, rebellious side. She questioned everything and viewed her environment critically. At the age of 7 years the first signs of Picasso's last stage came visible. Asymmetrical pop-art coloured faces, clown bees flying with friends over the ocean. Tolerance and equality were already very important to her.</p><p>During secondary school she developed into an all-round talent. Until now she has behaved like a sponge and likes to share her creativity with her loved ones. Her creative mind is not limited to a specific design area, but rather spreads through every fibre of her heart.</p>",
	14	:	"<p>The meaning of her name is 'luck' or 'happiness'. She always was a curious child and when she got paper and pens she started bringing her creativity on paper and ran free. That went so far, that she painted on the wall behind the couch, also doing handicrafts was something she really liked. Our neighbour Enno was always asking “can I come over?”. He told us then what she created out of the materials she found in the nature of the backyard and that he liked being creative together with her. He always said \"Feli has so much fantasy - that’s amazing\".</p><p>Parents</p>",
	15	:	"<p>Hubi's creativity started when he was 2 y.o., when he was in the throes of curiosity and systematically destroyed all mechanical toys searching for the mechanism that made them \"alive\". His life journey continued with obsessive drawings of robots and fantastic s-f related creatures up to 5 years old. The icing on the cake was when Hubi, than 7 years old, tried to convince his best friend that he had already been to China… but this story of his ambitious and stubborn approach, he can tell by himself. Finally, he made his dream come true by living, studying, working ....and skate-boarding in Beijing 10 years later! ...and I still remember his dead earnest look - when asked about his future career, Hubi announced, at the age of 17, that he would go into the skate-boarding business with his own line of signatured boards. My son, my pride.</p>",
	16	:	"<p>Ieva has been a very good friend of mine for ten years, since we studied together at art school. She is the most creative person I know, and puts her whole heart into her work. Her imagination has no limits and her skills inspire all of us. Every one of her pieces is full of soul and emotion, and she is the kind of artist that makes you feel fuzzy inside when you look at her work.</p><p>Ieva is very dedicated to her work, family, and friends, and she has been a hard-working artist for as long as I’ve known her. She was born talented, but with her ambition and determination she has accomplished so much and has made a place for herself in the art world.</p><p>Ieva is a brave and adventurous woman. From her spontaneous ideas to her crazy travels around the world, she inspires all those around her. Together, Ieva and I have had some wonderful times, beginning with our first shish experience in our teenage years to getting lost on a mountain in Norway.</p><p>Ieva has a lovely, bubbly personality, and no matter how far away she is in the world, she always remembers me and my family and comes back to Latvia to visit us here. I am so happy and grateful to call her my friend.</p><p>Elizabete Termane, friend</p>",
	17	:	"<p>Jana was born with her eyes gazing critically at the world. \"Do myself\" were her first words. \"You shouldn't judge things only by the way they look\" she was reminded by her parents, who meant well. Jana was one of those children that explored all sorts of hobbies but one thing was always the same with her: she produced neat reports - whether it was a botanical herbal, a book about music, kynology, or a report about wild duck mating calls. After getting her degree in business, she again focused more on the visual part of her powerpoint presentations than was perhaps necessary. But in 2012 it happened - BANG! - she entered the world of graphic design to finally fit in to an equally obsessed community. And never looked back.</p><p>Markéta, her friend</p>",
	18	:	"<p>People always wanted to keep Julie's drawings and designs. When she was about six years old, we went to visit a friend who had many antiques and artworks in her apartment. As we talked, Julie quietly took a piece of paper and a black pencil and started drawing an Art Deco vase with flowers that stood on the table. When we left, Julie offered to show the drawing to our host. She wasn't really interested, but on seeing it she exclaimed: \"Wow! Beautiful! Can I keep it?\"</p>",
	19	:	"<p>Laura’s creative abilities showed up unusually early in her life.</p><p>When she was just four months old and we left her without any clothes on, alone on her mattress, she became aware of the creative potential of her poo and started to distribute it thoroughly and with a great passion all over her body and the mattress. Although we didn’t praise her, her enthusiasm for handling and transforming pigments of all sorts had started to develop. In kindergarten she designed tickets and posters for concert and circus performances she made with her siblings, created hand crafted objects and sold them with a profit on the pavement in front of our house. Later on her creativity was mostly visible in her very self-confident way of dressing herself and in her so-called games of disguising. So her first career aspirations were consequently costume designer and trapeze artist. Not just the designer, but also the master of the art of living proved themselves earlier than usual. The following sentence, cheered triumphantly to her grandma who was pushing her sitting in her pram with a Bavarian brezn in one hand and an ice-cream in the other: “Grandma, we have a good life, haven’t we?” Thus the ideal foundations for a life as an artist had been laid.</p><p>Laura’s mum and dad</p>",
	20	:	"<p>Everyone has a different story but that is what makes everyone of us unique. Marianna's story started 21 years ago when she was born. Marianna was always an adventurous little kid. She loved to explore the world all around her, she was always trying new things and always wanted to learn something new, especially when it came to art. Art was one of her favourite subjects in school. She would always come home with paintings she painted in class. We always knew she liked art, but there was one time when we really realised that she was talented and she actually loved art. It was when Marianna and her art class took a trip to the Andy Warhol museum in Slovakia. They had a workshop based on different creative and practical activities, which she really enjoyed. What made her motivated, was when they told her they wanted to keep her work in the museum. After this experience, she told us that art was the direction she wanted to go. She wants to connect with people and she wants to make people happy through her work. Throughout the years her passion towards art brought her to where she is now - ready to accept challenges and learn new things.</p>",
	21	:	"<p>If I have to describe Mohini in one word it would be unique. Since childhood she's never been one for the masses. She started cursing at four. At six she put her head through a glass door because she didn't want to eat her vegetables. At eleven she bullied her friends into starting a school newspaper. At nineteen she dropped out of college to work and freelance. Whether it was her undying love for all animals or the hours she spent lost in books, I always knew my sister was different, and fearless about it. So now it's no surprise seeing her graduating from making disfigured sketches of animals to pursuing her passion for design.</p><p>Mallika, her sister</p>",
	22	:	"<p>When little, my daughter Sasha was very… well, little. Literally, she was small in size for her every age. Nevertheless, from the start she was smart, reserved, mature, very loved and cared about. When Sashenka, as we often call her, became a big sister, she learned to manage all by herself both in terms of entertainment and studying. We have tried very hard to provide everything Sasha needed for her development, and I remember that her room was organized in such a way that going round its perimeter she would find a ‘handyman’ corner with different tools, then, next to it, hundred of thematic stamps to create pictures, ponies, dinosaurs and other toys. Sasha drew a lot, mostly dragons, so, of course, there were books about dragons and just books. Unfortunately, we couldn’t take Sasha to an art school back then but we managed to have a young artist who would come once in a while for private lessons.</p><p>I am happy that I have never stopped doing everything that could develop Sasha’s musical or artistic taste, and as a family we have contributed a lot to her overall well-being.</p><p>There are so many things I would like to tell about my daughter’s versatile personality that it’s absolutely impossible to do as my love for her is so deep it fills me whole and I have no words to describe it.</p><p>Sasha’s Mom</p>",
	23	:	"<p>As far as I can remember, Pamela was always drawing, especially pictures of herself. They were always the same: blond hair, red lipstick, high heels and lots of cats around her.I was hoping this was a fad and she would move on to some other hobby but she didn’t. When it was time to apply for high school, Pamela wanted to audition for LaGuardia High School, which is one of the most competitive arts high schools in New York City. Initially, I was not very supportive because I didn’t want her to be disappointed if she was not accepted. But Pam #shepersisted, and much to my shock, was accepted. Fast forward to college and Pam announced she had found a school offering Graphic Design in Prague and I wondered, “Why Prague?” And Pam said “Why not? You will have a great place to come and visit me.” So here we are three years later and Pam is graduating and she was right about one thing - Prague is a great place to visit. I’m looking for a nice place to send her to graduate school.</p><p>Maureen Hickey, her mom</p>",
	24	:	"<p>Priyanka has had an intuitive grasp for colours since very early on in life. While studying in school, she practiced art externally in parallel. School had always  been a real push for her but art seemed to flow naturally. So finally after 10 long years of school and high school studies she started pursuing graphic design vigorously. With a limited attention span but lightening moments of idea generation she has excelled in her field.  I hope she continues to do so.</p><p>Khushboo, her sister</p>",
	25	:	"<p>That Rebecca would spend her life being artistically active was already clear to me when she wrote in her first kindergarten \"passport\" as a future professional career: \"painter\".</p><p>At this time, my husband and I served as her private art teachers, and soon she began to compete with her siblings through comics and self-made competitions. For her birthday, she got painting utensils and one time also an easel. Even today, Rebecca’s paintings hang on our wall; we are proud but she is embarrassed about them. Then everything went quite quickly, from secondary design school to the Munich Designschule  and today she is studying for her bachelor’s degree in Prague. She found what makes her happy and we are very satisfied about that: we try to support her as much as we can in what she is doing so that she continues with doing what fulfils her.</p><p>Mother</p>",
	26	:	"<p>Before Rebecca could hold a pencil at all, she painted herself with everything she could find. So she was doing a lot of installations rather than making classical drawings on paper. She always loved doing something with her hands, as well as building sculptures and collages. For example when I stitched her a nice curtain for her nursery, I saw her some days when she was cutting out all the tiny figures which were on the material because she found them so pretty and wanted to build something different out of them.</p><p>All the time, Rebecca restaged herself in a very imaginative and crazy way, even in the way she dressed herself. There was no way to say what she had to wear so she made the craziest colour compositions and wore them very self-confidently. She always knew - and knows - what she wants and just did it her way.</p>",
	27	:	"<p>As a kid Sara loved to help her dad in his workshop where she would saw, nail, build and paint her own designs. She also loved to cook and bake with her mom and she loved to do the dishes, a pastime she has now grown to hate. Sara also had a special love for animals that started with her catching and keeping pet frogs in glass jars. She named them all Matilda! When she moved to Malaysia with her family Sara got a second hand dog named Lucky that she trained to keep poisonous snakes away. The next stage in her animal obsession was to perform as a pyjama-clad humming fish with a self-designed papier maché fish head in her fourth grade theatre production of The Lorax. Ever since then Sara has never been the same so it’s no surprise she's taken the artsy route with a design degree.</p><p>Agneta & Bo, her mom and dad</p>",
	28	:	"<p>Sebastian has always been a creative child. Already in the kindergarten he would express his creative side with big handicrafts like airplanes or monster trucks. Most of the time they were made of toilet paper rolls and were so big he couldn’t carry them. Later at school his creativity shifted to Lego creatures, whereas he could build these without any manual. Painting and making handicrafts was in the background at this time, but came back at high school.</p><p>At this time he also got really interested in photography and art. In his work you can always see his special vision.</p>",
	29	:	"<p>Stefanie was a cheerful child who gladly moved into dream worlds, where she spoke with imaginary figures. Her best friend was a elfin prince named Cornelius, who lived a long time with us. In the kindergarten her creativity was especially displayed through the daily changing and styling of her Barbie army, but she also painted innumerable fashion designs for princesses. Early she fell in love with colors, on her face, on her hair, as well as on her clothes and on the wall. Everything could be the next opportunity for an unused canvas. Even her schoolbooks were all embellished with drawings. She realized quite early that she wanted to take a creative profession. She did already her first school internship in a graphic design agency and from then things took their course.</p>",
	30	:	"<p>Stella was a very eloquent child and loved to tell endless jokes she made up herself. Not only did she show creativity in telling stories but also started to draw early. She and her sister could be left alone in a corner for hours, spending the time just drawing.</p><p>Stella always refreshes us with her positive spirit. We are happy she found her vocation in design.</p>",
	31	:	"<p>What can we say about Tiana's create development?</p><p>Since she was a little child, Tiana had been entirely focused on painting or handcrafting. Her Mum collected all the paintings from her, so Tiana could look at them in the future. While that time came she had a lot of fun looking at them. Tiana also liked to use different materials, for example pattern or coloured pearls, to create new things, clothing and so on. She created really nice,funny and imaginative stories as well which she told everyone.Now we are happy that Tiana can use all her creative skills and talents she gained through her studies in her career.</p><p>Her whole family</p>",
	32	:	"<p>Veronika has always been the quite kid, she could be sitting anywhere as long as she had a paper and something to draw with and you wouldn't know she was there. She would start by drawing her pets and members of her family which we absolutely couldn't recognise and all we could do was to trust her. Then she evolve into drawing herself as a princess, which she believed she was. This is when her interest in fashion started, she didn't really care about anything but the dresses in her drawings, she was very persistent with color combinations and different styles of each dress. Drawing clothes became her new obsession, she left princesses and started drawing models wearing designs made up in her head. She made us believe becoming a fashion designer is her future. We truly believe putting her into art school was the right choice and we couldn't be more proud of her.</p>",
	33	:	"<p>Parents’ opinions about their child are, I think, always pre-considered. However, if Yura was receiving a prize similar to an Oscar, we would say he deserved it.</p><p>From early childhood, Yura was distinguished by his interest in the world around. Yura was interested in people’s life in foreign countries, how oil is produced, and most interesting of all, how to make most delicious pancakes. It appeared to him that this is the best way to bring people together.</p><p>In kindergarten Yura was so interested in filmmaking, that he once tried to recreate the Steven Spielberg movie \"Jurassic Park\". Unfortunately, the attempt failed and all the glory remained with Spielberg. That gave Yura an understanding that he needs to accomplish his goals.</p><p>In school Yura tried different professions: coder, interpreter, journalist, graphic designer and achieved a lot, performing the uneasy duties of the dog owner. Also, he became a traveller, which opened new horizons.</p><p>This story continued in Prague College. And you know how.</p><p>Yuriy’s parents</p>",
	34	:	"<p>Very early in the morning, when she woke from her dreams, Zoe always had creative ideas in her head and a lot of motivation for producing them. She did so with small things she found everywhere: Snail shells, berries, small branches, leaves, spoons, textile, snowballs and stones...</p><p>She was adding colors and new shapes to create something new – every morning.</p><p>When she was done, she would bring it to our bed and make an art gallery.</p><p>If you wanted to interrupt her in her creating-process she would always say: \"Do draws\" -  a simple but clear way to communicate that she wanted to continue creating. And she did!</p><p>Later she moved on to other things, other colors, other shapes, other impulses and in other media, but her creative motivation never changed.</p><p>Tilo Klöck, her father</p>",
	35	:	"<p>Zofia hasn’t really changed from when she was a child. You could always find her somewhere in some cozy corner or dad’s workshop doing something creative by her own. When she got new friends, she usually bored them away by drawing only and exclusively horses, and making them draw horses with her. Our attempt to make her attend art classes failed as she claimed that they make her draw people and she won’t ever use this skill because horses are more important. So we are glad she has found her own style now. Becoming a designer needs a lot of self-understanding and dedication which she certainly does not lack. Especially when it comes to horses.</p>"
