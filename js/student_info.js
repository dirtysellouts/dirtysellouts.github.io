	2	:	"<p>Most people thought Muội was a boy when Muội was a kid, because we too thought we was going to have another son, we did not have anything girly for her. As the result Muội dressed like a boy and had a boy haircut until she got to the 4th grade, when she grew her hair long for the first time in her life. Muội has showed her interest in fashion when she was almost 3. She always made drawings of super long and oversized culottes trousers. She drew on papers, on the walls and on her exercise books. Muội was interested in any kind of figures, like robots or dolls, so she can make clothes for them and cut their hairs if they had any. Muội has always loved to discover new things. She likes to make her own decision and there is no one that can stop her. We love her for who she is.</p>",
	3	:	"<p>When my daughter was born, I experienced a feeling of pride in myself and for her. A sense of beauty in the world. We have two children, Anna is 2 years, 2 months and 2 weeks younger than her brother. For the first 2 years of her life, Anya was a very serious child, so we specifically placed her next to her brother to watch cartoons. Alexey, her brother, burst into laughter at every, even insignificant situation, while she watched cartoons with a very serious expression. After a while she began to smile, and a little later she began to laugh. And so I thought maybe this was when she decided to become a great artist. How did Anna start painting? It suddenly occurred to us that our son had the ability to draw, so we sent him to art school. And where to put a ‘brother’s tail’ - Anya? Of course, with her brother, also in art school. My son quickly got bored, and he stopped going to art school, but our stubborn little one, our daughter, continued to attend. After a number of years, she graduated from art school with a “red” diploma. And so, her childhood hobby was not interrupted, as is the case with many children. After school she entered university in Russia (Graphic Design). Moreover, after graduating from the university, and receiving a “red” diploma, she informed us that this was not a sufficient for her education, and again she continued to study. Nothing has changed since her birth. She is still beautiful and everything she does is done with taste and consideration. We really love our baby.</p><p>Anna’s Mom</p>",
	4	:	"<p>Arthur's childhood had nothing to do with art in any form. He was never interested in sketching or drawing. As a child, he spent majority of his time on studying physics and training karate. First time he picked up a pencil was at his first university when he was supposed to sketch architectural blueprints. Even though that specialization wasn't connected with graphic design, he kinda enjoyed engaging with architecture. However, at that period of time, he was already interested in designing. He was spending all his time on producing various digital graphics and 3D models. Later in 2014, he decided to obtain another bachelor degree from the profession that he was highly passionate about. During three years at Prague College, he developed his skills significantly. Thanks to various school projects and assignments, he enriched his portfolio extensively. As a result, now he is ready to start his career as a graphic designer.</p>",
	5	:	"<p>Bianca has always been a bright and inquisitive child. Early on, her creative vein was characterized by the fact that she wanted to convince her friends to build her own space shuttle to explore the expanses of the universe. When she received her first Walkie-Talkie and some mysterious and undefined noises sounded, she was absolutely convinced that she had finally made contact with extraterrestrial life (even if it was only the radio frequencies of our neighbours). But still today, she follows her dreams firmly and is absolutely determined to implement her ideas. Also, from a professional point of view, it does not surprise us that she has chosen an artistic direction. We will support her in all of her further projects and decisions.</p>",
	6	:	"<p>Carla was a very quiet child and instead of playing games, she wanted to draw pictures and do handicrafts all the time. There was one parents evening in the kindergarten when the kindergarten teacher told us that we should not be afraid of paper scraps because children need to be creative. At this time I did not know that in Carlas case the kindergarten teacher meant not only her childhood. Carla loves to create collages and sometimes the floor of her room was all over with tiny scraps. Surprisingly, until now paper scraps play an important role in her life.</p>",
	7	:	"<p>It all began on Friday, December 8, 1995, at precisely 11:20 am. That day a small wonder named Charlène was born. 3,890kg, 52cm, black hair, a pretty little face and already a lot of voice: everything suggested a strong personality. This was confirmed and the main aspects of her character appeared very quickly: laughing always laughing, eyes bigger than the belly, and a real actress.</p><p>A few years later, this beautiful laughing baby has become an adorable mischievous little girl, smiling and very sociable. Then this is a serious, dynamic and applied child who has taken the path to school. At that time, we couldn’t say that she showed technical prowess in drawing... However Charlène always had a real attraction for manual works, a lot of imagination and a very creative spirit.</p><p>Today, she is a passionate student who is ready to take on all the challenges to make her dreams come true.</p>",
	8	:	"<p>David started to draw very early, there is barely any picture of him without a piece of paper and a pen, he soon changed his drawings into first designs. Around 10, he was obsessed with drawing clothes, he even made a brand called daho. When he got interested in cars, he only wanted to draw cars and wanted to become a car-designer. When he became older and life was more about going out, his design obsession seemed to get less and less, but as it seems, he hasn’t lost it until now.</p>",
	9	:	"<p>When David was a kid he would always spend his time playing with LEGOs. That was true even as he grew up. Apart from LEGOs, though, he’s never really drawn much or had any kind of creative pastime. Once he was old enough to use a computer on his own, he became more and more interested in video games and computers in general. A couple of times he even messed something up with the software and had to reinstall everything. Or he would take it apart and put back together just to see what’s inside. Honestly, I wouldn’t have thought he’d end up doing design.</p>",
	10	:	"<p>Dora started to scribble before she started walking. After her mother and I told her that drawing on the walls was off limits, she started finding hidden spots to draw on (under her bed, for example!). She started school and proclaimed she was going to be an artist and, of course, nobody believed that because her drawing skills were awful. She got into a language high school instead of an art school and we sighed with relief... which was very temporary because she didn't stop drawing and still claimed she will indeed do that for a living. When she told us she got accepted into graphic design, I was sure that was going to be a complete failure. Yet, here she is, successfully graduating! I know she is good at what she is doing, but she'll always be that kid that scribbled on my walls to me.</p><p>Petko Ivanov, her dad</p>",
	11	:	"<p>When Eben was growing up as a kid, he always cries when his outfit get dirty. He normally sleeps with any new outfit we get him and no one dares to take it away from when going to sleep. As a parent, we noticed his love for colors (color pencils to be precise) when he started school and anywhere he goes he will cry all because of color pencils. That was very disturbing for us, so we had no choice to carry color pencils anywhere we go with him. It seemed like that was important to him than snacks. And one thing he normally say to people was ‘he will buy mummy a cat and a truck.</p><p>So me seeing him now a designer, I am not really surprise though we wanted him to do business.</p>",
	12	:	"<p>When our \"Lenochka\" finally learned to walk, she took a pencil to her right hand and came to the wall for starting to express her creativity. She was using walls as her canvas. Once we got tired of her graffiti art, she found her interest in illustrating the books, by feeling them with her drawings. When she saw a single piece of paper lying somewhere, Lena immediately used it for her drawings. Her favourite character was always a bear. Outside the house, she loved to draw in the sand with a first stick she found. When we were taking her somewhere, we always had paper and pencils with us, because we knew that it is what she likes to do. We understood that she have a graphic talent, but we thought that it is just a hobby, as every child has, but later we realized that it’s more than that. Her soul was asking for it. She has a very sensitive soul and we realized, that she has the ability to notice things, which other people can’t.</p>",
	13	:	"<p>Although Elli comes from a family of artists her creative development needed a little bit longer to unfold. She was rather pretty good at arguing and haggling if it was about something she truly wanted (like food or books).  If she didn’t get it, she showed her stubborn rebel. She questioned everything and viewed her environment critical. At the age of 7 years the first signs of Picasso's last stage came visible. Asymmetrical pop-art coloured faces, clown bees flying with friends over the ocean. Tolerance and equality was already very important to her.</p><p>During secondary school she developed into an all-round talent. Until now she behaves like a sponge and likes to share her creativity with her beloved ones. Her creative mind is not limited to a specific design area rather spreads through every fibre of her heart.</p>",
	14	:	"<p>The meaning of the name is „lucky her“ or „happiness“, she always was a curious child and when she got paper and pens she started bringing her creativity on paper and ran free. That went so far, that she painted on the wall behind the couch, also doing hand crafts was something she really liked. Our neighbour Enno was always asked „can I come over?“, he told us then what she created out of the materials she found in the nature of the backyard and that he liked being creative together with her. He always said „Feli has so much fantasy that’s amazing“.</p>",
	15	:	"<p>Hubi's creativity started when he was 2 y.o., when he was in throes of curiosity and systematically destroyed all mechanical toys searching for the mechanism that made them \"alive\".His life journey continued with obsessive drawings of robots and fantastic s-f related creatures up to 5 y.o. As 6-7 y.o. Hubi went frenzy while creating (with skillful mum's sewing touch) KG and school carnival costumes (although always vanished into thin air when it came to asking a girl for dance or show his flamboyant costume in public). The icing on the cake is a story when Hubi, than 7 y.o., tried to convince his best friend that he had already been to China, but this story of his ambitious and stubborn approach…he can tell by himself. Finally he made his dream come true by living, studying, working ....and skate-boarding in Beijing 1o years later! ...and I still remember his dead earnest look -when asked about his future career, Hubi announced he will go into skate-boarding business with his own line of signatured boards (at that time 17 y.o.)...</p><p>My son, my pride</p>",
	16	:	"<p>Ieva has been a very good friend of mine for ten years, since we studied together at art school. She is the most creative person I know, and puts her whole heart into her work. Her imagination has no limits and her skills inspire all of us. Every one of her pieces is full of soul and emotion and she is the kind of artist that makes you feel fuzzy inside when you look at her work.</p><p>Ieva is very dedicated to her work, family, and friends, and she has been a hard-working artist for as long as I’ve known her. She was born talented, but with her ambition and determination she has accomplished so much and has made a place for herself in the art world.</p><p>Ieva is a brave and adventurous woman. From her spontaneous ideas to her crazy travels around the world, she inspires all those around her. Together, Ieva and I have had some wonderful times, beginning with our first shish experience in our teenage years to getting lost on the mountain in Norway.</p><p>Ieva has a lovely, bubbly personality, and no matter how far away she is in the world, she always remembers about me and my family and comes back to Latvia to visit us here. I am so happy and grateful to call her my friend.</p><p>Elizabete Termane, friend</p>",
	17	:	"<p>Jana was born with her eyes gazing critically at the world. “Do myself” were her first words. “You shouldn't judge things only by the way they look” she was reminded by her parents who meant well. Jana was one of those children that explored all sorts of hobbies but one thing was always the same with her: she produced neat reports - whether it was a botanical herbary, a book about music, kynology or a report about wild duck mating calls. After getting her degree in business, she, again, focused more on the visual part of her powerpoint presentations than was perhaps necessary. But in 2012 it happened - BANG! - she entered the world of graphic design to finally fit in an equally obsessed community. And never looked back.</p>",
	18	:	"<p>People always wanted to keep Julie's drawings and designs. When she was about six years old, we went to visit a friend who had many antiques and artworks in her apartment. As we talked, Julie quietly took a piece of paper and a black pencil and started drawing an Art Deco vase with flowers that stood on the table. On our leave, Julie offered to show the drawing to our host. She wasn't really interested, but on seeing it she exclaimed: \"Wow! Beautiful! Can I keep it?\"</p>",
	19	:	"<p>Laura’s creative abilities showed up unusually early in her life.</p><p>When she was just four months old and we left her without any clothes on alone on her mattress, she became aware of the creative potential of her poo and started to distribute it thoroughly and with a great passion all over her body and the mattress. Although we didn’t praise her, her enthusiasm for handling and transforming pigments of all sorts had started to develop. In kindergarten she designed tickets and posters for concert and circus performances she made with her siblings, created hand crafted objects and sold them with a profit on the pavement in front of our house. Later on her creativity was mostly visible in her very self-confident way to dress herself and in the so called games of disguising. So her first career aspirations were consequently costume designer and trapeze artist. But not just the designer, but also the master of the art of living proved themselves earlier than usually. The following sentence, cheered triumphantly to her grandma who was pushing her sitting in her pram with a Bavarian brezn in one and an ice-cream in the other hand: \"Grandma, we have a good life, haven’t we?\" Thus the ideal foundations for a life as an artist had been laid.</p>",
	20	:	"<p>Everyone has a different story but that is what makes everyone of us unique. Marianna's story started 21 years ago whenever she was born. Marianna was always adventure, little kid. She loved to explore the world all around her, she was always trying new things and always wanted to learn something new, especially when it comes to art. Art was one of her favourite subjects in school. She would always come home with paintings she painted in class. We always knew she likes art, but it was one time when we really realised that she is talented and she actually loves art. It was when Marianna and her art class took a trip to Andy's Warhol museum in Slovakia. They had a workshop based on different creative and practical activities, which she really enjoyed. What made her motivated, was when they told her they want to keep her work in the museum. After this experience, she told us that art is the direction she wants to go. She wants to connect with people and she wants to make people happy through her work. Throughout the years her passion towards art brought her to where she is now. Ready to accept challenges and learn new things.</p>",
	21	:	"<p>If I have to describe Mohini in one word it would be unique. Since childhood she's never been one for the masses. She started cursing at four. At six she put her head through a glass door because she didn't want to eat her vegetables. At eleven she bullied her friends into starting a school newspaper. At nineteen she dropped out of college to work and freelance. Whether it was her undying love for all animals or the hours she spent lost in books, I always knew my sister was different, and fearless about it. So now it's no surprise seeing her graduating from making disfigured sketches of animals to pursuing her passion for design.</p><p>Mallika (sister)</p>",
	22	:	"<p>When little, my daughter Sasha was very… well, little. Literally, she was small in size for her every age.Nevertheless, she was right away smart, reserved, mature, very loved and cared about. When Sashenka, as we often call her, became a big sister, she learned to manage all by herself both in terms of entertainment and studying. We have tried very hard to provide everything Sasha needed for her developments, and I remember that her room was organized in such a way that going round its perimeter she would find a ‘handy man’ corner with different tools, then, next to it, hundred of thematic stamps to create pictures, ponies, dinosaurs and other toys. Sasha drew a lot, mostly dragons, so, of course, there were books about dragons and just books. Unfortunately, we couldn’t take Sasha to an art school back then but we managed to have a young artist coming once in a while for private lessons.</p><p>I am happy that I have never stopped doing everything that could develop Sasha’s musical or artistic taste, and as a family we have contributed a lot to her overall well-being.</p><p>There are so many things I would like to tell about my daughter’s versatile personality that it’s absolutely impossible to do as my love for her is so deep it fills me whole and I have no words to describe it.</p><p>Sasha’s Mom</p>",
	23	:	"<p>As far as I can remember, Pamela was always drawing, especially pictures of herself. They were always the same: blond hair, red lipstick, high heels and lots of cats around her. I literally had hundreds of her drawings all over my house.I was hoping this was a fad and she would move on to some other hobby but she didn’t.</p><p>When it was time to apply for high school, Pamela wanted to audition for LaGuardia High School, which is one of the most competitive arts high school in New York City. Initially, I was not very supportive because I didn’t want her to be disappointed if she was to accepted. I thought her odds of getting into LaGuardia were slim to none. But Pam, she persisted, and much to my shock, was accepted. Fast forward to college and Pam announces she found a College that offers Graphic Design in Prague and I wondered, \"Why Prague?\" And Pam said \"Why not? and besides you will have a great place to come and visit me.\" So here we are three years later and Pam is graduating and she was right about one thing - Prague is a great place to visit. I’m looking for a nice place to send her to graduate school.</p>",

	25	:	"<p>That Rebecca will spend her life to be artistically active was already clear to me as she wrote in her first kindergarten \"passport\" as a future professional career: \"painter\".</p><p>At this time, my husband and I served as her private art teachers, and soon she has begun to compete with her siblings through comics and self-made competitions. For her birthday, she got painting utensils and one time also an easel. Even today, Rebecca’s paintings hang on our wall, we are proud but she is embarrassed about them. Then everything went quite quickly, from the secondary design school to the design school Munich and today she makes her bachelor in Prague. She found what makes her happy and we are very satisfied about that, we try to support her as much as we can in what she is doing so that she continues with doing what fulfills her.</p>",
	26	:	"<p>Before Rebecca could hold a pencil at all, she painted herself with everything she could find. So she was doing a lot of installations rather than making classical drawings on paper. She always loved doing something with her hands and building sculptures and collages. For example when I stitched her a nice curtain for her nursery, I saw her some days when she was cutting out all the tiny figures which were on the material because she found them so pretty and wanted to built something different out of them.</p><p>All the time Rebecca restaged herself in a very imaginative and crazy way, also in the way she dresses herself. There was no way to say what she has to wear so she made the craziest colour compositions and wore them very self-confident. She always knew and knows what she wants and just did it her way.</p>",
	27	:	"<p>As a kid Sara loved to help her dad in his workshop where she would saw, nail, build and paint her own designs. She also loved to cook and bake with her mom and she loved to do the dishes, a pastime she has now grown to hate. Sara also had a special love for animals that started with her catching and keeping pet frogs in glass jars. She named them all Matilda! When she moved to Malaysia with her family Sara got a second hand dog named Lucky that she trained to keep poisonous snakes away. The next stage in her animal obsession was to perform as a pyjama clad humming fish with a self designed papier maché fish head in her fourth grade theatre production of The Lorax. Ever since then Sara has never been the same so it’s no surprise she's taken the artsy route with a design degree.</p>",
	28	:	"<p>Sebastian has always been a creative child. Already in the kindergarten he could express his creative side with big handicrafts like airplanes or monster trucks. Most of the time made of toilet paper rolls, they were so big he couldn’t carry them. Later at school his creativity shifted to lego creatures, whereas he could build these without any manual. Painting and handcrafting was in the background at this time, but came back at highschool.<p></p>At this time he also got really interested in photography and art.</p><p>In his work you can always see his special vision.</p>",
	29	:	"<p>Stefanie was a cheerful child who gladly moved into dream worlds, where she spoke with imaginary figures. Her best friend was a elfin prince named \"Cornelius\" who lived a long time with us. In the kindergarden her creativity especially displayed through the daily changing and styling of her barbie army, but she also painted innumerable fashion designs for princesses. Early she fell in love with colors, on her face, on her hair, as well as on her clothes and on the wall. Everything could be the next opportunity for an unused canvas. Even her schoolbooks were all embellished with drawings. She realized quite early that she wants to take a creative profession and did already her first school internship in a graphic design agency and from then things took their course.</p>",
	30	:	"<p>Stella was a very eloquent child and loved to tell endless jokes she made up herself. She did not only show creativity in telling stories but also started to draw early. She and her sister could be left alone in a corner for hours, spending the time just drawing.</p><p>Stella always refreshes us with her positive spirit. We are happy she found her vocation in design.</p>",

However, if Yura was receiving a prize similar to Oscar, we would say he deserved it.</p><p>From early childhood, Yura distinguished by his interested in the world around and being open minded. Yura was interested in people’s life in foreign countries, animal behaviour, how oil is produced, and most interesting of all, how to make most delicious pancakes. It appeared, this is the best way to bring people together. In kindergarten Yura was so interested in filmmaking, that once tried to recreate a Steven Spielberg movie \"Jurassic park\". Unfortunately, the attempt failed and all glory remained with Spielberg. That gave Yura and understanding that he needs to accomplish his goals.</p><p>In school Yura tried different professions: mentor, coder, interpreter, journalist, graphic designer and achieved a lot, performing uneasy duties of the dog owner. Also, he became a traveller, which opened new horizons. That time of his life was not easy but exciting as a start of a new great story.</p><p>This story continued in Prague College.

	34	:	"<p>Very early in the morning, just awake of her dreams, Zoe always had creative ideas in her head and a lot of motivation for producing them. She did that with small things she was finding (everywhere): Snail shells, berries, small branches, leaves, spoons, textile, snowballs and stones…</p><p>She was adding colors and new shapes for creating something new – every morning.</p><p>When she was done, she brought it to our bed and made it an art gallery.</p><p>If you wanted to interrupt her in her creating-process she was always saying: „Doe draws“.</p><p>A simple but clear way to communicate that she wants to continue creating. And she did!</p><p>Later with other things, other colors, other shapes, other impulses and in other media, but her creative motivation never changed.</p>",
	35	:	"<p>Zofia hasn’t really changed from when she was a child. You could always find her somewhere in some cozy corner or dad’s workshop doing something creative by her own. When she got new friends, she usually bored them away with drawing only and exclusively horses and making them draw horses with her. Our attempt to make her attend the art classes failed as she claimed that they make her draw people and she won’t ever use this skill because horses are more important. So we are glad she found her own style now. Becoming a designer needs a lot of self-consciousness and dedication which she certainly does not lack. Especially when it comes to horses.</p>"
